# Semantic Textual Similarity and Classification with Transformer Models

This Python script performs semantic textual similarity analysis and classification using transformer models.

## Features

* **Semantic Textual Similarity:**
    * Calculates cosine similarity between sentence embeddings generated by transformer models.
    * Evaluates similarity between question-answer pairs.
    * Determines the better fit among given options for a sentence.
* **Transformer Model Usage:**
    * Utilizes transformer models from Hugging Face Transformers.
    * Supports models like Jina, CosmosE5, and E5.
* **Sentence Embeddings:**
    * Generates sentence embeddings using the selected transformer model.
* **Classification:**
     * Performs classification using Logistic Regression.
* **Evaluation:**
    * Evaluates the performance of semantic similarity and classification tasks.
    * Calculates accuracy and generates classification reports.
* **Visualization:**
    * Visualizes sentence embeddings using t-SNE.
